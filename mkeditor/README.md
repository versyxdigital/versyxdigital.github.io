MKEditor fully supports the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) spec and comes with a few additional goodies.

**Great** support for _custom_ styling with:

- Bootstrap
- Fontawesome
- Highlight.js

Create alerts:

```md
::: primary
✨ Create alerts
:::
```

Format some code:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    document.body.write('Syntax-highlighted, copyable codeblock!')
})
```

MKEditor also includes a built-in, resizable preview renderer and support for exporting your markdown to HTML, with or without styles 🚀.

Customize your settings, switch between light mode and dark mode, write some documents and have fun!
